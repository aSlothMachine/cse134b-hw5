Notes: For the extra credit using React, I was not sure how to work with React documnetation on web components with the HW specs. It was a bit confusing if I needed to extend my class to React.component vs. HTMLElement, 
and if I was even able to create a custom element since all the documentation had `<div id="root">` always.
